                <p> A Houston-born hip-hop artist and producer affiliated with
                    Kanye West's GOOD Music and T.I.'s Grand Hustle, Travis
                    Scott became known during the early 2010s for his heavily
                    Auto-Tuned half-sung/half-rapped vocal style. Within seven
                    years of his mainstream arrival via West's Cruel Summer
                    compilation (2012), on which he served as co-producer and
                    featured artist, Scott attained numerous platinum singles as a
                    lead artist, including a streak of four that began with
                    "Antidote," a single off his number three hit debut album
                    Rodeo (2015). Scott followed with a pair of number one full-
                    lengths, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016) and Astroworld (2018)
                    , all the while assisting in platinum singles headlined by the likes 
                    of Rihanna ("Bitch Better Have My Money"), SZA ("Love Galore"), and Drake 
                    ("Portland"), and working extensively with Quavo as Huncho Jack. Whether 
                    leading or supporting, Scott's presence was unmistakable , almost always c-
                    olored with an array of ad-lib trills including but not limited to "It's lit," 
                    "Yeah, yeah," and "Straight up." The buildup to Scott's first proper studio album 
                    involved the Days Before Rodeo mixtape, promoted with the singles "Don't Play" and 
                    "Mamacita," and the March 2015 U.S. Rodeo Tour, headlined by Scott and supported by 
                    Young Thug and Metro Boomin. Several of the dates sold out. The same month, Rihanna's 
                    Scott-produced hit single "Bitch Better Have My Money" was released. "3500" and "Antidote" 
                    were released ahead of Rodeo, Scott's second full-length, which followed in September on 
                    Grand Hustle/Epic and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. Toward the end of the 
                    year, "Antidote" peaked at number 16 on the Hot 100 and became Scott's first platinum single. 
                    Leading up to his third LP, Scott was featured on a slew of tracks, including platinum singles 
                    headlined by SZA ("Love Galore"), Drake ("Portland"), Miguel ("Sky Walker"), 2 Chainz ("4 AM)," 
                    and Trippie Redd ("Dark Knight Dummo"). Scott's own "Butterfly Effect" arrived during this torrent 
                    of hits in May 2017 and promptly went platinum as well. Seven months later, Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, 
                    a collaborative full-length with Quavo, entered the Billboard 200 at number three. The following May, 
                    Scott released "Watch," a non-album track featuring Kanye West and Lil Uzi Vert, and within three months 
                    released Astroworld, which he considered the true follow-up to Rodeo. Featuring "Butterfly Effect," the album 
                    -- named after a demolished Houston amusement park -- debuted at number one and was supported with a second single, 
                    "Sicko Mode." Scott closed out 2018 by appearing on multiple tracks of Metro Boomin's Not All Heroes Wear Capes album. 
                    After collaborating with Young Thug and J. Cole on 2019's "The London" and being featured on Ed Sheeran's "Antisocial," 
                    he issued his own solo single, "Highest In the Room." JackBoys, a brief compilation showcasing artists from Scott's Cactus 
                    Jack Records label, appeared at the end of the year. The release subsequently became the first number one album of the 2020s.
